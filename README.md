# Welcome to my Data Engineering Project! <br>
This project will be all about showcasing what I've learned from my course in Data Engineering. I will be building a data model, forwarding that model into an actual database, manipulate and insert data into the database using Python, created data pipelines, and finally showcasing the results in a presentable way using Tableau.

I started off this project created the data model using MySQL Workbench. I went with a relational database.
